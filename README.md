# Image-sharpening-using-knowledge-distillation
This project implements a deep learning approach to restore sharp images from blurred inputs using a teacher-student model architecture via knowledge distillation. The goal is to train a compact and efficient neural network (student) that performs nearly as well as a larger, more powerful model (teacher), with less computational cost.
